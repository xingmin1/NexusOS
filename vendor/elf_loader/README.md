# elf_loader

English | [中文](README_zh.md)  

`elf_loader` can load and relocate various forms of ELF files from memory or files, including `Executable file`, `Shared object file`, and `Position-Independent Executable file`.

[Documentation](https://docs.rs/elf_loader/)

# Usage
`elf_loader` can load various ELF files and provides interfaces for extended functionality. It can be used in the following areas:
* Use it as an ELF file loader in operating system kernels.
* Use it to implement a Rust version of the dynamic linker.
* Use it to load ELF dynamic libraries on embedded devices.
* Use it to load elf files on Windows. See [windows-elf-loader](https://github.com/weizhiao/rust-elfloader/tree/main/windows-elf-loader).

# Capabilities
### ✨ Works in `no_std` environments ✨
`elf_loader` does not depend on Rust `std`, nor does it enforce `libc` and OS dependencies, so it can be used in `no_std` environments such as kernel and embedded devices.

### ✨ Compact Size ✨
The `elf_loader` is extremely small in size. The [mini-loader](https://github.com/weizhiao/rust-elfloader/tree/main/mini-loader) implemented based on `elf_loader` compiles to a binary file of only **26KB**. Below are the results from analyzing the binary using the `bloat` tool:
```shell
cargo bloat --crates --release --target=x86_64-unknown-none -Zbuild-std=core,alloc,panic_abort -Zbuild-std-features=panic_immediate_abort,optimize_for_size
    Finished `release` profile [optimized] target(s) in 0.28s

Note: numbers above are a result of guesswork. They are not 100% correct and never will be.
```

### ✨ Fast speed ✨
This library draws on the strengths of `musl` and `glibc`'s `ld.so` implementation and fully utilizes some features of Rust (such as static dispatch), allowing it to generate `high-performance` code.   
Below are the performance test results. You can view them in the `bench` job on GitHub Actions.

```
It's important to note that `elf_loader` is not a dynamic linker and cannot automatically resolve dynamic library dependencies. However, it can serve as the underlying layer for implementing a dynamic linker.

### ✨ Very easy to port and has good extensibility ✨
If you want to port `elf_loader`, you only need to implement the `Mmap` and `ElfObject` traits for your platform. When implementing the `Mmap` trait, you can refer to the default implementation provided by `elf_loader`: [mmap](https://github.com/weizhiao/elf_loader/tree/main/src/mmap). In addition, you can use the `hook` functions provided by this library to extend the functionality of `elf_loader` to implement any other features you want. When using the `hook` functions, you can refer to: [hook](https://github.com/weizhiao/dlopen-rs/blob/main/src/loader/mod.rs) in `dlopen-rs`.

### ✨ Provides asynchronous interfaces ✨
`elf_loader` provides asynchronous interfaces for loading ELF files, which can achieve higher performance in scenarios where ELF files are loaded concurrently.   
However, you need to implement the `Mmap` and `ElfObjectAsync` traits according to your application scenario. For example, instead of using `mmap` to directly map ELF files, you can use a combination of `mmap` and file reading (`mmap` creates memory space, and then the content of the ELF file is read into the space created by `mmap`) to load ELF files, thus fully utilizing the advantages brought by the asynchronous interface.

### ✨ Compile-time checking ✨
Utilize Rust's lifetime mechanism to check at compile time whether the dependent libraries of a dynamic library are deallocated prematurely.   
For example, there are three dynamic libraries loaded by `elf_loader`: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Library `c` depends on `b`, and `b` depends on `a`. If either `a` or `b` is dropped before `c` is dropped, the program will not pass compilation. (You can try this in the [examples/relocate](https://github.com/weizhiao/elf_loader/blob/main/examples/relocate.rs).)

### ✨ Supports Lazy Binding ✨
The `elf_loader` supports lazy binding, which means that when a symbol is resolved, it is not resolved immediately, but is instead resolved when it is first called.

### ✨ Supports RELR relative relocation format ✨
The `elf_loader` supports the RELR relative relocation format. For detailed information on RELR, please refer to: [Relative relocations and RELR](https://maskray.me/blog/2021-10-31-relative-relocations-and-relr).

# Example
## Load a simple dynamic library
```rust
use elf_loader::load_dylib;
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    fn print(s: &str) {
        println!("{}", s);
    }

    // Symbols required by dynamic library liba.so
    let mut map = HashMap::new();
    map.insert("print", print as _);
    let pre_find = |name: &str| -> Option<*const ()> { map.get(name).copied() };
    // Load and relocate dynamic library liba.so
    let liba = load_dylib!("target/liba.so")
        .unwrap()
        .easy_relocate([].iter(), &pre_find)
        .unwrap();
    // Call function a in liba.so
    let f = unsafe { liba.get::<fn() -> i32>("a").unwrap() };
    println!("{}", f());
}
